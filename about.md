## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.profile-picture}}">

My name is Dominik Penner. I'm a 21 year old infosec enthusiast and security researcher. I specialize in web-app security and operating systems. I have helped a wide variety of organizations secure their systems over the course of approximately 7 years. Some of these include: Internet Service Providers & Electronic Medical Software vendors. My main focus is to report critical vulnerabilities in software/hardware before malicious adversaries have the opportunity to exploit them.
